/**
 * Returns a nullish schema with the same metadata as the original schema.
 *
 * Why we need this?
 *
 * By default Zod's `nullish` method will generate a `anyOf` JSON schema, with
 * the second branch being `{ type: null }`, therefore, if users set `null` to a
 * field in the YAML file, when hover over the field in VSCode, there will be no
 * metadata for the field at all.
 *
 * Here we generate a new metadata for the nullish schema, so no matter whether
 * the field is set to `null` or not, the metadata will always be the same.
 *
 * @param schema - The zod schema to make nullish.
 * @returns A nullish schema with the same metadata as the original schema.
